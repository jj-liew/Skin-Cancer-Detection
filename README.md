# Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning Method
This repository contains the implementation of an AlexNet deep learning model trained on the HAM10000 dataset. The model leverages segmentation images to enhance the accuracy of skin lesion classification. The project includes data preprocessing and model training, demonstrating the use of deep learning for medical image analysis.

## Dataset
The HAM10000 dataset is a widely used, publicly available collection of over 10,000 dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. The dataset can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000).

## Reproducing the results
The notebook is written to download the dataset and store it in your Google Drive for convenience. Simply follow the cell blocks to reproduce the results.
